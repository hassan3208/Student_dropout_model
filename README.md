# 🎓 Student Success Predictor

A machine learning-powered Streamlit web app that predicts whether a student is likely to succeed academically based on their personal, financial, and academic background.

## 🚀 Live Demo

👉 [Click here to try the app](https://your-app-name.streamlit.app) *(Replace with your Streamlit Cloud link)*

---

## 📦 Features

- Predict student success using multiple ML models: KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Option to compare all models for majority voting.
- Interactive UI with user-friendly inputs.
- Visual feedback (balloons, snow, emoji) based on prediction result.

---

## 🧠 Models Used

- ✅ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- 🌲 Decision Tree
- 🌳 Random Forest

All models are pre-trained and saved as `.pkl` files using `joblib`.
